### Eslint + Prettier + Husky + Lint-Staged + Jest

> **Important**
>
> - The package manager that should be used is npm.
>   Otherwise husky might not run as expected. Yarn has a different approach to start husky.

- I have prepared the project to run eslint , prettier and jest on my vscode.
  Also, to ensure that the code that is been commited to this github repo have prettier and lint applied, IÂ´ve configured Husky to run lint-staged that runs eslint , prettier and tests before any commit.
